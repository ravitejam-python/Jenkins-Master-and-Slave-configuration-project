# Jenkins-Master-and-Slave-configuration-project


ðŸ§° Prerequisites
Jenkins Master server
Slave server with Java installed


Procedure:
Goto Manage Nodes

Manage Jenkins --> Manage Nodes and Clouds --> New Node
Add the node name as Permanent Agent

Provide below information to add Jenkins agent
Name: uniquely identifies an agent within this Jenkins installation
Description:
Number of executors: 2
Remote root directory: /home/ec2-user/maven-agent
Labels: Labels (or tags) are used to group multiple agents into one logical group.
Usage:

Use this node as much as possible
Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node
Launch method:

Launch agent by connecting it to the master
Launch agent via execution of command on the controller
Custom WorkDir path: custom Remoting work directory will be used instead of the Agent Root Directory
- Use WebSocket [x]
Availability:

Keep this agent online as much as possible
Bring this agent online according to a schedule
Bring this agent online when in demand, and take offline when idle
Once you save above configuration you will get a command which should be executed in the agent. it contains agent.jar, a secret-file, and a jnlp file

  echo "secret_key" > secret-file
  java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://<Jenkins_URL>/computer/abc/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret @secret-file -workDir "/home/ec2-user"
Once connected you can create or edit a job to chose this option in the Restrict where this project can be run

Lessons Learned:
Master and slave should have
same Java version
Same Maven version
In case Jave or Maven paths are referring to the agent system then aline it according to masters Global Tool Configuration
In case the case of the AWS server make sure your Jenkins URL should be updated to the latest Public IP.
